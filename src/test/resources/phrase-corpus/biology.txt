AL8 1057 A clever organiser with a history tutor on his hands may persuade the citizens of Chipping Camden that they do not really want a class in biology, they want one on Queen Victoria: but (make no mistake) that very persuasion will to some extent have injured the mainspring of voluntaryism in adult education in Chipping Camden.

AMG 192 Robin Fox (1971, 1972) and Lional Tiger (1969) in influential books have perhaps pushed this approach to an extreme, but they have thereby generated an important renewal of interest in biology among anthropologists.

B17 832 A series of studies, usually by men, have argued that the female biology determines their temperament or personality, and makes women more passive and timid.

B76 1465 Some of his biology is not too sound; his statement that the gulls of the northern hemisphere may be exceptional —‘In the majority of species such gradual variation is not seen, and all the members are equally interfertile’— seems based on a plentiful lack of knowledge of the work that has been done on geographical variation in many groups of animals, including birds.

B7G 1934 But Nucleic Acid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology includes fairly comprehensive coverage with emphasis on the biochemical aspects.

CBF 293 ‘I have not been the same since the assault,’ the 20-year-old student said at her flat near Hanover, where she is continuing her biology degree course.

CEE 948 This true type, having found her man, was forced to accept that biology was indeed destiny.

CHE 991 However, quite a few teachers took an interest in what I was trying to do, especially the biology teachers, who were impressed with my knowledge of birds and conservation, and my English teachers, who soon heard all about my interest because whenever we had to give a talk in class, I would launch into a full lecture on rearing and handling owls and other birds of prey.

CJ1 426 The most commonly seen current formulations of this model alternatively emphasize either a maximizing human nature determined by biology, or a tabula rasa wholly tractable to the collective will of society, either the ‘selfish gene’, or the selfless primitive communist at one with the collective consciousness of his group.

CJU 702 Candidates with an interest in molecular biology, protein biochemistry and immunology are urged to apply.

CM8 1552 Pupils in the UK and USA, taking even very elementary courses in biology and zoology, were taught the skill.

CMR 1102 Feminists who take a more woman-centred approach have developed a positive view of women's biology, and have based a full theory of gender relations on it (see Chapter 5).

CMR 1369 Woman-centred, traditional, and egalitarian feminist psychologies all define their subjects as rational and autonomous, and ultimately ground them in biology.

ECB 1599 Instead she suggests that the content of the formal curriculum should be entirely overhauled: ‘for girls to become a more powerful group, they must be given some understanding of females' past powerlessness…in other subject areas, like English literature, social studies, art, biology and — where it is taught — psychology, there is a similar need to examine what girls are learning about women's abilities and potential, and therefore what they should (realistically) expect for themselves’(Hannon, 1979, p. 115).

EDH 72 Obviously, we cannot explain these very striking variations in behaviour via biology, since the people in the various societies were all the same biologically.

EEL 195 Carole is fortunate, she does not have to obtain biology specimens for ‘A’ level English examination boards.

EW6 1245 Of course the thrust of the programme of molecular biology is to extend contemporary physics into biology in just such a way.

FBD 344 The crucial question for evolutionary biology is where the balance is struck between signalling real information about your state and signalling misinformation.

FBP 540 That is not so much a sign that molecular biology is a young person's game, but rather a proof of how great a magnet for young people's enthusiasm the structure of DNA has proved to be.

FU1 444 She is redoing her A-levels in chemistry, physics and biology in the sixth form of a London girls' school.

FYX 731 For example, if the proton-neutron mass difference were not about twice the mass of the electron, one would not obtain the couple of hundred or so stable nucleides that make up the elements and are the basis of chemistry and biology.

G07 2200 C. I got O level in Maths and Biology;

G0Y 417 All we can do is hope that Mrs W. will cool off and in the meantime, Edward, I'm sorry but honestly I think Mary or Janice had better take over Junior Biology.’

G0Y 438 ‘Then can I teach biology?’

G34 164 The writings of French feminists, rehearsing this argument about the limits of biology and the beginnings of culture, have been inspirational: not only Cixous, with her rallying cries to women to assert their ‘otherness’ but also Luce Irigaray.

G3E 2349 To the right lay a couple of buff-coloured laboratory files with biology registrations and, beside them, flat open on the bench, a quarto-sized loose-leaf notebook with a ring binding.

GSX 1222 In 1912 Punnett was appointed to the Balfour professorship of biology at Cambridge — effectively the first chair of genetics to be established anywhere — after Bateson had declined it.

H10 590 But, in the language of social anthropology, "kinship" has very little to do with biology; it refers rather to a widely ramifying pattern of named relationships which link together the individual members of a social system in a network.

HPU 510 It was due to scholars such as Lazarsfeld in providing a logic of social research which encouraged the making of the connection between research problems in biology, particularly eugenics, which had stimulated the development of inductive statistics, and those of social research.

HTD 1483 The Division is sub-divided into three units, the Institute of Cell, Animal and Population Biology, the Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology and the Institute of Ecology and Resource Management (see individual entries below).

HTD 1500 The Centre comprises a modern transgenic facility with full laboratory amenities for molecular biology, stem cell manipulation (gene targeting), cell culture and mammalian genetics as well as a grade 3 containment suite.

HTE 1808 Biology and Chemistry are the most appropriate subjects, but these two sciences are not obligatory for entrance, nor are applicants who offer them given preference.

HTE 1848 A specialised course in Immunology in the third year builds on earlier courses in cell and molecular biology, and leads to an honours specialisation in the fourth year.

HX0 588 Candidates must take three credits from one of the biology, chemistry, and physics groupings, plus two credits from another.

J52 none biology

J52 1505 I could have quoted basically the same words from almost any Jehovah's Witness tract, but I choose this book because a reputable publisher (Pan Books Ltd) saw fit to publish it, despite a very large number of errors which would quickly have been spotted if an unemployed biology graduate, or indeed undergraduate, had been asked to glance through the manuscript.

K8Y 1441 Denote this intervention by X. In the case of agriculture, biology, medicine and even psychology, formal laboratory or field experiments can usually be done; in the social sciences this is generally not possible but a good survey can often be thought of in quasi-experimental terms.

KC3 2126 Biology?

KCC 563 well they were having a biology lesson, she'd been all about these , they'd been this biology

KRH 3199 There have been scientific developments, of course, in chemistry, but perhaps it's seen now as being more important in the context of the contribution it's making to other important areas such as biology, environmental science and so forth .
