A0P 702 Accordingly, he read arts in his first year; commerce (which included accounting, commercial law, political science and a couple of doses of mathematics) in his second; arts (though strangely retaining political science) for his third and fourth years, to which was added zoology.

A3Y 150 Two of the papers in Science came from Japan and reported on individuals suffering from Type A syndrome, a rare variant of Type 2 diabetes.

A5Y 31 We do not wish to commit the mistake that Woolgar believes is widespread in social science: namely, of suggesting that the only knowledge which is not subject to the influence of contingent historical, cultural, and social processes is that which we ourselves have written (Woolgar 1988b).

A6L 1804 As far as the Science Museum is concerned it's a question of helping it with the whole game of raising finance and all the other things they have to do.

ABD 2700 SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

ANX 1613 Although keen to attract industry into funding health science, he is profoundly opposed to companies setting up ‘slush funds’ that would cover the costs of a particular project.

APN 607 The view that, somehow, science (here, agricultural technology) is neutral and it is the fault of ‘irrational’ politicians or pressure groups is a widely-held one — even if a little sheepishly.

B71 1161 In order to redress this global imbalance in scientific expertise, Third World countries need to build up their own capabilities in science, technology and especially in chemistry.

B74 618 But then dissent in geology, as in any science, is good.

B7N 618 THE National Science Foundation in the US funded a two-to three-year study ‘to examine the many areas of controversy over the scientific use, development, and application of gene-transplantation research’.

BLY 618 In some subjects and topics, particularly in Mathematics and Science, English language embodies western thought patterns and there is a risk that translation may lead to fundamental misunderstandings.

C9F 1355 The nominees for the science award have years and years of experience behind them.

CBH 103 An alternative science — what could be called a psychodynamic science — has been described as the study of live objects which are seen, experienced and recognised subjectively in contrast to traditional sciences which study ‘objects only’:

CES 1292 Nigel was wont to say, ‘Before knocking the iniquities of present-day science and talking about the good old days, think about dentistry, and modern pain-killing drugs and anaesthetics.’

CLT 972 Having looked at the equipment and principles involved in setting up the tank, we now approach the art (and science) of aquarium decor.

CLW 2 A Model to Link Personality Characteristics to a Preference for Science

CLW 9 Maslow (1966) and Hudson (1966 and 1968) saw science as providing an emotionally undemanding activity appealing to boys moving from the calm of latency to the turbulence of adolescence.

CLW 105 Is it possible to change school science in this fashion and still preserve the essential character of science itself?

CLY 182 Crabby's science of dates and sums and writing seemed a typical invention of her own…prison labour like picking oakum or sewing sacks.’

CS0 978 In this context the remarks of a wise old West African (Bangwa) witch-doctor, comparing witchcraft and modem science, seem eminently appropriate.

E9U 855 The movement of air masses and pressure zones globally are beamed to the science department of Thomas Lord Audley School, Colchester.

EA4 none social services

F9Y 314 It's science fiction set in a London police box.

FA1 1667 KH It's an art almost, rather than a science?

FA6 170 Chapter 7 discusses a similar process at work amongst the humanities students, and also points to certain differences between the science and the humanities students.

FA6 1267 I see education as far more than just training you to go out and do a job, and I think the whole learning process, whatever you're learning, matures you into being capable of taking responsibilities and learning other things, and I think arts subjects do that just as well as science subjects.

FBE 724 The enterprise of science consists in the proposal of highly falsifiable hypotheses, followed by deliberate and tenacious attempts to falsify them.

FBE 1334 This coherent programme might be compared with modern sociology, much of which is sufficiently concerned with empirical data to satisfy the falsificationist if not the inductivist criteria of good science and yet fails miserably to emulate the success of physics.

FBE 1783 For Kuhn, whether a field qualifies as a science or not depends on whether or not it conforms to the account of science offered in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions .

FBN 645 We, as hobbyists, can only wait for science to throw some further light on the confusion; but we should, I think, be extra careful to make sure we don't mix the different types when selecting breeding stock.

FLX 243 Even if chewing in class is not allowed in a science lab.

Hackmann,John and Jonathan Cuthbertson: the Invention and Development of the Eighteenth Century Plate Electrical Machine (Communication no. 142, National Museum of the History of Science), Leiden 1973, and Electricity from Glass: the History of the Frictional Electrical Machine 1600–1850 , 1978, pp. 154–64.]

GU7 456 Some theoretical science, such as thermodynamics, depended upon this process.

GVW 822 This indeed is one of the reasons why Hare in 1969 noted ‘sometimes I think that Geography as a science deliberately stays out of phase with the climate of the times.’

H8V 118 Literary studies remain a specific and coherent science; literariness still remains its object, and is still constituted by the differential strategy which opposes defamiliarization and automatization.

H99 1245 In BC all of the main classes can be grouped into four main areas: Philosophy, Science, History and Technologies and Arts.

HJ2 1906 05: Political science and international relations

HLG 2409 Baker talks with Russian officials — Creation of science research centre

HPE 23 Trent International Centre for School Technology [TICST]is commissioned by the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Engineering Council (joint sponsors of the WISE Project which began in January 1984) to operate converted buses as mobile teaching/exhibition vehicles to support a programme of activities which will bring to the attention of girls (particularly 13–14 year olds at option time), parents and the general public, the roles and opportunities for women in Science and Engineering.

HPN 1926 These too may be unrepresentative, since very expensive ‘big science’ projects make disproportionate demands on funding, and scientists cannot be defined simply as those people in receipt of research grants.

HTE 2134 The remaining two thirds may be made up from a combination of full or half courses in many subject areas, for example chemistry, physics, maths, oceanography, geophysics, geographical sciences, meteorology, archaeology, astronomy, computer sciences, psychology, science studies, economics, arts subjects, languages, law, etc.

HTE 2173 Career opportunities in environmental science are expanding, particularly in fields such as water supply, environmental impact assessment, engineering geology and pollution monitoring and control.

HX0 553 The qualification has been designed to make it possible for candidates to select modules which will give them the equivalent of at least three Highers in arts or social science areas.

HXT 237 Radicals attribute this to the control of an autonomous medical science and knowledge, Marxists to the class position and function of doctors within capitalism.

J0P 1178 Moreover, with such confidence in the methods of science it is not surprising that educated men of the second half of the century were immensely impressed with its achievements.

J53 1227 Devaluing activity, assimilating it in analogous models (art, science, technology), design makes of itself models of its practice which deny design (in the sense we have been working towards here) both in process and in end.

K5D 6054 A RESEARCH team at Glasgow University has just received a £1.5 million grant from the Science and Engineering Research Council to carry out a project to increase the capacity of fibre-optic cables, writes Eric McKenzie

KRH 2756 Yes, I'm sure we do, and I think that's to do with our notions of what science is.
