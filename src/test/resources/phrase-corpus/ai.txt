CM2 none Artificial intelligence - Addresses, essays, lectures

CM2 826 I have no strikingly original view of machines and consciousness to offer, nor shall I present a survey of the views of those in artificial intelligence (AI for short) who have discussed their relation, for the simple reason that there are none, at least in the sense of well-articulated philosophical views.

F9W 1553 The schema activated by the opening leads to one interpretation of ‘nails’ and ‘seal’— a phenomenon referred to in Artificial Intelligence as expectation driven understanding — and the schema is upset by an unexpected continuation, probably making you reread.

K5D 11315 PAUL BEDWORTH: Now studying artificial intelligence.

KRF 224 Oh, that's a difficult one to answer, isn't it? erm I think that we're unique in this country, possibly, especially Sussex and one or two other places, in having erm a mixture of artificial intelligence, psychology, erm microelectronics.

KRH 3377 Now there is a class of systems, so-called expert systems, which have come out of artificial intelligence research, which can do much more than that, are much more intelligent.

KRH 3395 A particular research project that I and two colleagues, Keith Baker and Erin Sloman, have a grant from the Science Research Council for is to look first of all at the problems of getting such as system with, well at the moment three but possibly up to twelve computers, working on a given existing artificial intelligence problem to see how to take this big program — it's called Popeye — it's a research project to study various areas of visual perception, as you say — to see how to break this down and have it running simultaneously on a number of much smaller computers, rather than on the single big computer that it's running on at the moment.

KRH 3472 The thing is moulded under your eyes, and a recent book which has been very popular in the university Gödel Esher Bach which is on some of the aspects of artificial intelligence and ideas, has in its preface got quite a long article on how the author actually organised all of the processes, right through to the final printing of that book, and indeed even wrote the programs for formatting the text, and it has obviously been very stimulating for him.
