EV6 1126 In the mouse, a C-band is located adjacent to the centromere in all but the Y chromosome (see also Chapter 5, Section 5.2.

EV6 1496 The normal mouse has 40 chromosomes which are all acrocentric with centromeres close to the terminus and almost invisible short arms.

EV6 1519 Some additional information has emerged but, unfortunately, mouse chromosomes have not responded well to the high resolution techniques developed for human chromosomes and it is only recently that a higher resolution idiogram has been published (14).

FTB 369 Nevertheless, to address this question, cDNA from mouse, rat, and dog muscle was amplified by using a 5' oligonucleotide primer complimentary to the N-terminal end of α AChR (coding sequence 61–83) and a 3' oligonucleotide primer of sequence 734–756.
